    Credit card approval prediction involves using machine learning models to assess whether a credit card application is likely to be approved based on an applicant's financial and personal data, such as income, credit history, and employment status. This prediction is important because it helps financial institutions streamline the approval process, reduce the risk of granting credit to high-risk applicants, and ensure that credit is extended to individuals who are likely to repay. By making more accurate decisions, it boosts customer satisfaction and supports the stability of the credit system.  <br>
    The goal of this project is to develop and refine machine learning models for predicting credit card approvals, with a focus on handling imbalanced datasets. By exploring various algorithms and techniques, we aim to find the most accurate model for predicting approval outcomes. Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, special attention is paid to techniques that address this challenge, ensuring that the model performs well across all classes. The process includes training, validating, and testing the models to ensure they are robust and reliable. Ultimately, the objective is to integrate the best-performing model into credit approval systems, enhancing decision-making and minimizing risks.
